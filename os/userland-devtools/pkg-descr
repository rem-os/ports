This FreeBSD OS port installs programs, libraries, and header files that are
used to build other software. Some major programs like clang, make, and lldb
are included. If you want to build and/or compile anything, you will need to
install this port.

Restricted jails may want to skip this port, to minimize the arsenal available
to intruders.
