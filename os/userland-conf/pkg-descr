This FreeBSD OS port installs the configuration files that are included
in the /etc directory. These files are updated when using 'pkg upgrade' or
the 'base-update' system utility. Files that are unable to be merged
automatically can be interactively updated using the 'base-update merge'
command.

WARNING: Removing this package will delete your configuration files in /etc!
