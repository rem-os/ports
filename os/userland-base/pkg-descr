This FreeBSD OS port installs the directories and files that are apart of
/usr/share as well as /libexec and /usr/libexec. It is part of the 'userland'
metapackage, and is normally installed as part of its dependancy chain.

This package includes the 'base-update' command, which can be used to safely
update your base-package system.
