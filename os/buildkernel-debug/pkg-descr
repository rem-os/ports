This FreeBSD OS port performs the 'buildkernel' portion of the base build,
using the default KERNCONF with WITNESS and other debugging explicitly enabled.
The resulting kernel is packaged and stored as a .txz file in /usr/dist/.

This .txz file is used by other OS ports in the packaging process for the
kernel. This package does not need to be installed for runtime.
