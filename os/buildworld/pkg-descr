This FreeBSD OS port performs the 'buildworld' portion of the base build.
The resulting world is packaged and stored as a .txz file in /usr/dist/.

This .txz file is used by other OS ports in the packaging process for the
userland. This package does not need to be installed for runtime, but may
be helpful to feed into other programs that can make use of a tarball of
world, I.E. jail managers, Poudriere and similar.
